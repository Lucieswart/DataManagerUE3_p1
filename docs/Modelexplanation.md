bFontez: comment and explain what each nn layer is doing and the interest of this layer in the following model : model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size),
    nn.Softmax(dim=1)
).to(device)

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's break down the model defined using PyTorch's `nn.Sequential`:

```python
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size),
    nn.Softmax(dim=1)
).to(device)
```

### Explanation of Each Layer

1. **`nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)`**:
    - **Purpose**: This is a fully connected (dense) layer that takes the input features and maps them to a set of hidden features.
    - **Input**: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, input_size)`.
    - **Output**: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`.
    - **Interest**: This layer learns weights and biases to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space, which can help in capturing complex patterns.

2. **`nn.ReLU()`**:
    - **Purpose**: This is a non-linear activation function called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).
    - **Input**: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`.
    - **Output**: A tensor of the same shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`, with all negative values set to zero.
    - **Interest**: ReLU introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex functions. It also helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

3. **`nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)`**:
    - **Purpose**: Another fully connected layer that maps the hidden features to the output features.
    - **Input**: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`.
    - **Output**: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, output_size)`.
    - **Interest**: This layer transforms the hidden features into the final output features, which correspond to the number of classes in the classification task.

4. **`nn.Softmax(dim=1)`**:
    - **Purpose**: This is a softmax activation function applied along the specified dimension (in this case, dimension 1).
    - **Input**: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, output_size)`.
    - **Output**: A tensor of the same shape `(batch_size, output_size)`, with values representing probabilities that sum to 1 along the specified dimension.
    - **Interest**: Softmax converts the raw output scores into probabilities, which are useful for classification tasks. It ensures that the output can be interpreted as the likelihood of each class.

### Summary
This model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with softmax activation. The hidden layer helps in capturing complex patterns in the data, while the softmax layer provides a probabilistic interpretation of the output, making it suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
